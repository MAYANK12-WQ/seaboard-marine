## 🎓 THINGS TO KNOW

### For Boss to Understand:

1. **AI is not 100% accurate** - Always review generated docs
2. **Cost is pay-per-use** - Not a fixed monthly fee
3. **Bigger files = higher cost** - Proportional to size
4. **Prompt affects cost** - Detailed prompts use more tokens
5. **Version control helps** - Find best prompt for your needs

### Best Practices:

1. Start with small files to learn
2. Refine prompts gradually
3. Save good prompt versions
4. Monitor costs weekly
5. Backup generated documentation
